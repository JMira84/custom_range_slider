# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
